An analysis involving music, data, and machine learning</a>\n      <p>In this article by Juan De Dios Santos, he tries to figure out if his library is \"boring\", as so claims his friend.</p>\n      <p>He goes through a few different methods, one of which I ended up using for the Boring-Radar: standard deviation.</p>\n      <p>One of his methods was an equation he created, based on what he think would be good at a party:</p>\n      <p class=\"equation\">boringness  =  loudness + tempo + (energy  x  100) + (danceability  x  100)</p>\n      <p>While writing an equation for \"boringness\" is amusing, I disagree with the idea that \"boring\" music is anything not great to head bang to at a party.</p>\n      <p>I did decided to use this equation for my Banger-Level, but made adjustments.</p>\n      <p>Loudness is a weird inconsistant value that in my opinion has no place in the equation, so I removed it.</p>\n      <p>Tracks have gotten louder over time, which doesn't serve to prove that they're LOUD, just means you don't have to turn your speakers up as much.</p>\n      <p>The average tempo of all music is around 116 BPM, which means an \"average\" tempo already has more weight than energy and danceability which max at 100.</p>\n      <p>I thought it was stupid to weight tempo that much, so I equalized it. If tempo is higher than an average, it adds. If it's lower, it subtracks from the score.</p>\n      <p>Finally I though energy was far more important than danceability.</p>\n      <p>Conceptually danceability should be equal with energy, but I found it's value to be inconsistant and not as worth while as energy</p>\n      <p>Here's my equation:</p>\n      <p class=\"equation\">bangerness  =  (tempo  -  96) + (energy  x  100) + (danceability  x  50)</p>\n      <p>Very opinion based, but I found my personal results consistant. I find it easier to look at your \"Top Bangers\" to understand how the value works, than to look up songs you attribute to being \"bangers\".</p>\n      <p>I needed the value to be between 0-1, so from trial and error I found that a consistant max for my \"banger equation\" was 210, giving my library of 4,300 songs a consistant bell curve.</p>\n      <p>The final equation:</p>\n      <p class=\"equation\">bangerness  =  ((tempo  -  96) + (energy  x  100) + (danceability  x  50))  /  210</p>\n      <p>Quantifiable Track Banger-Level</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
